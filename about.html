<!--         <div class="section">
            <p>
                This visualization tool is a key component of the Microbiome Constellation project, spearheaded by TMS lab. 
                It offers an interactive platform to navigate and understand intricate graph data in microbiome research.

                Our visualization is based on 77 publicly available datasets from the curatedMetagenomicData package 
                (see <a href="https://waldronlab.io/curatedMetagenomicDataCuration/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
                We focus on data from patients with various health states, including a healthy baseline, Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), 
                Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), Colorectal Cancer (CRC), and adenoma. The database encompasses over 14,000 samples 
                collected from 36 countries.

                To construct the graph, we employed the graphical lasso technique (more information available 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_lasso" target="_blank">here</a>). This method helps identify 
                direct relationships between microbial species. For instance, if species A and B are directly connected, 
                alterations in A can have a direct impact on B, and vice versa, regardless of other variables.
